# EA_Restaurant
Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of cost per two persons in a Restaurant

In this project, we used data which was extracted from Zomato API, and available in Kaggle.
We used Google colab for writing the code and testing the models. We have used Python (Pandas) for cleaning the data and Pyspark for Pipelining data and streamlining the Machine Learning Algorithms. In this project we have taken several features as input and we predicted the cost for 2 people dining in a restaurant based on the past values.
We used Python Visualization capabilities for performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
The entire source code is available in source_code.ipynb file.
Thank You.
